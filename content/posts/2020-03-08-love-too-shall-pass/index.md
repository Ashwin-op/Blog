Probably the day had come mate!

There were times in life when love took off for me, leaving me behind. No matter how careful I was, it seemed like there was always something that managed to slip through the cracks. All of a sudden, love — the love I thought I’ve known so well, had gone. And there, I was left alone: sad, depressed, confused, angry, disappointed, brokenhearted…

I kept on questioning what went wrong when things started to crumble, how come I didn’t notice the signs earlier. And there were moments when I felt as if this was the end of it. That I won’t be able to forget the one who left, that I won’t be able to love again, that I would never feel the same way about someone new ever again, that I won’t be able to move on…

But the truth is: love (like everything else), too, shall pass. It might take an excruciating 6 months, a year, five years, or even fifteen to fifty years, but it’ll pass. Either you’re moving on because you feel like the time has come, or because it’s the only thing you can do to survive, it doesn’t matter. It. Will. Pass. At one time gently, leaving lovely memories; other times painfully, leaving scars you’ll bring along with you through life.

But life is always full of endings and beginnings.

One day, you’ll wake up in the morning realizing that your pillow is no longer damp from last night’s tears; understanding that this is it. This is the day when you’ve let love pass through you, to let it transform and give life to something new. Something fresh. Something yet unknown — some love that is still waiting for you at the other side of hope.

> And that reminds of something in my favourite language Tamil-காதலும் கடந்து போகும் (Kadhalum Kadandhu Pogum) meaning Love too shall pass..and maybe it should for the well being…!
